Built and deployed Elastic Stack SIEM for a clients SOCs (security operations center). Configured Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana with custom dashboards for real-time threat monitoring. Set up Filebeat and Winlogbeat agents across their network for centralized log collection. Created correlation rules that helped detect APT activities and suspicious behavior patterns. The deployment improved their incident response time and provided better visibility into network security events.
